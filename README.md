# Boat-Simulation
Modelling and simulation of boat motion driven by waves, completed as a project for Cooper Union's Mechanical Vibrations course (ME-301).

## Explanation
For a full explanation of the model, simulation, assumptions, and derivations, see "Boat_Simulation_Report_ME301.pdf".

## Examples
Even if you don't or can;t run the MATLAB scripts yourself, feel free to check out the examples I uploaded to YouTube. You'll find three unique base cases, along with two demonstartions of what can happen when the model assumptions are severaly violated. You can find these in the following YouTube playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL037oNHJf5_lcm--UkWwKi_tHQm7ZkWzV

## Instructions
Modify parameters as desired and run the "boat_model.m" MATLAB script to generate 3D simulation of wave/boat motion or the "boat_model_V2.m" script to generate the 3D simulations and additional partial models and vibrations analysis plots.
