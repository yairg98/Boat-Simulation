# Boat-Simulation
Model and simulation of boat motion driven by waves, completed as a project for Cooper Union's Mechanical Vibrations course (ME-301).

## Explanation
For a full explanation of the model, simulation, assumptions, and derivations, see "Boat_Simulation_Report_ME301.pdf".

## Instructions
Modify parameters as desired and run the "boat_model.m" MATLAB script to generate 3D simulation of wave/boat motion or the "boat_model_V2.m" script to generate the 3D simulations and additional partial models and vibrations analysis plots.
